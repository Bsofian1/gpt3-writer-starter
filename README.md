## Introducing Seth ai  

Imagine you can ask any question to Seth Godin? He will be just there, right next to you, waiting for you to ask anything.  
And you could really ask anything, not just limited to subjects from the thousand of articles he already wrote on his blog.  
I wanted to explore GPT-3, a new AI model created by Open AI. I pre-trained my model to answer all our questions based on Seth published articles and his Marketing philosophy. 
So yes, Seth will better answer your Marketing question than giving style advice. 
I didn't want Seth to do all the thinking, I want you and me to also participate. This is why I decided to add questions that Seth might ask at the end. Feel free to share your personal answer to those questions around.
